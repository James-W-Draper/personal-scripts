Here is the clean way to build a running tally of completions.

## 1. Prep

* If your date field has times, create a pure date column:

  ```
  DateOnly = DATEVALUE('Fact'[Date Completed])
  ```
* Create a proper date table and relate it to Fact[DateOnly]:

  ```
  Date = CALENDAR(MIN('Fact'[DateOnly]), MAX('Fact'[DateOnly]))
  ```

  Model view: relate Date[Date] -> Fact[DateOnly]. Mark Date as a date table.

## 2. Measures

Add these DAX measures on your fact table.

**Count of completed**

```
Completed count =
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER('Fact', NOT ISBLANK('Fact'[DateOnly]))
)
```

**Running total - respects current slicers**

```
Running completed =
VAR MaxVisibleDate = MAX('Date'[Date])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    [Completed count],
    REMOVEFILTERS('Date'[Date]),
    'Date'[Date] <= MaxVisibleDate
)
```

Notes

* `REMOVEFILTERS('Date'[Date])` removes only the date grain, so page slicers for other fields still apply.
* If you want the running total to reset per year, use:

  ```
  Running completed YTD =
  CALCULATE([Completed count], DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))
  ```
* If you need a running total per category, replace `REMOVEFILTERS('Date'[Date])` with:

  ```
  ALLSELECTED('Date'[Date])
  ```

  and add `ALLEXCEPT('Fact','Fact'[Category])` if you want it to reset per category.

## 3. Visual

* Insert a Line chart.
* X-axis: Date[Date].
* Values: Running completed.
* Make sure X-axis type is Continuous so missing dates show with a flat line rather than gaps.
* Optional: add slicers for Product, Region, etc. The measure will respect them.

## 4. Common gotchas

* Missing dates: you must use a contiguous Date table to see a smooth running line.
* Duplicates on the same day: fine, the count is of rows with a nonblank completed date.
* Time zone or time parts: use the DateOnly column to avoid same-day splitting.
* Blanks: the filter in the measure already excludes blanks.

## 5. Quick measure alternative

If you prefer the UI: Modelling -> New quick measure -> Running total. Base value = Completed count, Field = Date[Date], set it to show cumulative. This builds similar DAX, but the manual version above is cleaner.

If you paste your table and column names, I will drop in measures with your exact schema.
