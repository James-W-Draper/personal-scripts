# Delete_folders.ps1
# Written by James Draper 28/10/2024
# Updated 31/10/2024
# Version 1.2 - rewritten some of the functions to use approved verbs
# Version 1.1 - fixed a minor bug with the icacls command.

# $scriptFolder: This variable points to C:\scripts as the folder where both the log file and the CSV will be stored.
# Write-Log: This function logs messages to the log file, including timestamps to track when events happen.
# Test-Permission: This function checks whether the current user has FullControl permissions on the folder using Get-Acl. If the user has the required permissions, it returns $true; otherwise, it returns $false.
# Set-Ownership: If the current user doesnâ€™t have permissions, the script will attempt to claim ownership of the folder using the takeown and icacls commands. If successful, it logs the success; otherwise, it logs the error and skips further actions on the folder.
# Remove-Folder: The function Remove-Item is used to delete the folder and all its contents (-Recurse -Force flags). If successful, it logs the deletion; otherwise, it logs any encountered errors.
# Invoke-FolderProcessing: The script reads the CSV file using Import-Csv, checks permissions for each folder, claims ownership if necessary, and then attempts to delete the folder. Each action is logged to the log file.
# Make sure you save your CSV file ($csvPath) and the script (delete_folders.ps1) within the folder specified in $scriptFolder
# Run the script with administrative privileges to ensure takeown and icacls can execute.

# Define the folder where the log file and CSV are located
