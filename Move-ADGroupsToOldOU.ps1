# Powershell script to move groups to OU's
# Summary of the Script in Laymanâ€™s Terms
# This script automates the process of moving Active Directory groups back to their original locations (called Organizational Units or OUs).
# It works by reading a list of group names and their old and current locations from an Excel file. 
# For each group, it checks if the group exists in Active Directory, and if it does, it moves it back to the specified "old" location.
